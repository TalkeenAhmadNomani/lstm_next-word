# LSTM Next Word Prediction

This project demonstrates a **Next Word Prediction** model using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.

The model is trained on a custom text corpus and predicts the most likely next word based on the previous sequence of words.
